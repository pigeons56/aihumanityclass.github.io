**Course Description:**

Most decisions today are made by software, most of the rules of
society are interpreted and enforced by programs, and much human
interaction is now mediated by computing platforms that decide what
people see and who they can talk to. As the people who decide what
software gets written and how it is deployed, computer scientists have
disproportionate power to mold society &mdash; for both good and bad.
This will be a discussion and project-based seminar focused on ethical
issues faced by computing systems and the people who design, build,
and deploy them.

**Course Objectives:** The goal of this course is to raise awareness
and increase understanding of the moral and ethical aspects of
computing systems. This course is more about raising questions and
developing intellectual frameworks for thinking about difficult
problems than about developing technical skills. Few, if any, of the
problems we will discuss have easy answers, but hopefully we will have
an engaging time discussing them and develop more sophisticated ways
of thinking about them.

**Class Meetings:** The scheduled course meetings are Tuesdays and
  Thursdays at 9:30-10:45am. Because parts of the class will be based on discussions and in-class activities, it is essential that students attend and fully participate
  in the scheduled class meetings.


# Communication

We will primarily use the course website for one-to-many
communications (posting course materials) and the [github
Discussions](https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions)
site for interactive discussion.

**Course Website:** All course materials that can be posted publicly
  will be posted at
  [_https://csethics.github.io_](https://csethics.github.io). We may
  occasionally use the collab site to post materials we cannot post
  publicly.

**Discussion:** We will use the github discussions site for
  interactive discussions:
  [_https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions_](https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions). (See more about this below.)

# Course Format

The course will be divided into five teams of five students each. Most
weeks, one of the teams will be responsible for leading the class; one
of the teams will be responsible for writing the blog post about the
week; and the remaining students will be responsible for writing short
reaction posts and engaging in the discussion both on-line and in
class.

The standard week for the course will be something like this:

**Wednesday night (or earlier):** Reading/Viewing Assignment specified

**Sunday, 10:59pm:** Initial responses to reading assignment due (posted in Discussions forum)

**Tuesday, 9:30-10:45am:** Class meeting (first meeting on the week's topic)

The team leading the week should have a plan for what to do both
Tuesday and Thursday, but should be adaptive to what happens in class
on Tuesday. This could include assigning additional (but not overly
time consuming) tasks for students to do before Thursday, as well as
provoking on-line discussion that would build on the in-class
discussions Tuesday, and set-up the Thursday meeting.

Before Tuesday's class meeting, the group responsible for leading the
following week's discussions should have prepared a plan and candidate
list of materials for the next week (with my help), and meet with me
after class Tuesday to finalize the plan for the following week.

**Thursday, 9:30-10:45am:** Class meeting (second and final meeting on
  the week's topic)
