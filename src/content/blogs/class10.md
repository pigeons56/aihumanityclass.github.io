## Discussion: Outsourcing Intelligence: The Human Cost of AI Development

Team 8 began class with a discussion of the often invisible human labor that powers AI systems. The news presentation focused on an Equal Times article that reports on data labelers in the Philippines. These workers are performing repetitive tasks to train AI models, such as identifying objects in images, much like the reCAPTCHA systems many of us often encounter. 

Team 8 featured several quotes from workers describing the conditions they face in these roles. “I work between 8 and 10 hours per day for an average of €6,” says Junbee, 22, from one of Cagayan de Oro’s slums. Another worker, John-Henry, said, “The alternative is selling drugs. But I want a future.”

Team 8 introduced the author, Théophile Simon, a French freelance journalist who has focused on human rights and the ethics of AI since 2023. They also pointed out that Equal Times is a publication that covers labor rights and social justice issues globally. 

Team 8 then transitioned to positioning AI outsourcing in the context of neocolonialism, which is the idea that wealthy nations exert control over developing countries through economic rather than political means. Interestingly, they explained that data has replaced raw materials as the resource being extracted. The risk and harm of content moderation and data labeling is outsourced to workers in the Global South, while the value generated is felt by tech companies in wealthy nations. They noted that 70% of companies confirm outsourcing is more economical, and 92% of G2000 companies utilize IT outsourcing services. The Philippines holds 13.5% of the global outsourcing market.

Particularly disturbing was the discussion of content moderation work, where workers must view traumatic content, such as violence and sexual assault, in order to train AI systems to recognize and filter such material. These workers are being paid wages below the legal minimum to complete tasks that carry a psychological toll.


**Discussion Question 1:** _Do you think that AI Companionship is overall beneficial or harmful to society_?
