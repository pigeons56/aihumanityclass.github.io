You can use this template for your blog, but also look at previous examples from other blogging teams for help on structuring your blog.

In general, writing for the web is different from writing for other media. You should break your text into fairly short paragraphs, and including images and links is highly encouraged! 

Replace this with your blog!

# Marking Big Heading

## Little Heading

This is _italics_ and **bold**. You can use latex math, but probably won't need to for this blog.

To include an image, store the image file in src/content/static/images/. Then, use
<img src="/images/humanitylogo.png" width=80% alt="This is the course logo"></img>

If you have other files to include, put them in static/docs.

You shouldn't need to change the layouts or other files, but if you want to improve them without breaking things, that's fine.
