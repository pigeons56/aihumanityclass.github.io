_Can we produce the required adjustments with the necessary speed? The most hopeful answer is that the human species has been subjected to similar tests before and seems to have a congenital ability to come through, after varying amounts of trouble. To ask in advance for a complete recipe would be unreason able. We can specify only the human qualities required: patience, flexibility, intelligence._. 
John von Neumann, [Can we survive technology?](https://sseh.uchicago.edu/doc/von_Neumann_1955.pdf), 1955.




_Scientists are some of the most dangerous people in the world because
we have this illusion of objectivity; there is this illusion of
meritocracy and there is this illusion of searching for objective
truth._
Timnit Gebru (quoted in [_Dealing With Bias in Artificial Intelligence_](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/artificial-intelligence-bias.html)), New York Times, 19 November 2019)
